Create Download Statistics
==========================

You may have noticed that HistView now also (optionally) provides download links.
Moreover, if you enable the use of the download class, you have the possibility
to record download statistics to your MySQL database (see the example files
provided). And here you find an example of the table you need to use that:

CREATE TABLE statistics (
  dl_date	DATE,
  prog		VARCHAR(30),
  newver	VARCHAR(10),
  referrer	VARCHAR(100)
);

No primary key needed for this. If you really want one, add a column "id" and
make it auto-increment - but it's really not needed.

As the name "newver" suggests, you can also have a column "oldver" (and many
others) - but these are not (yet?) used by HistView and/or the download class.
However, if you want to use more columns for something: No problem, the
download class will simply ignore them.
